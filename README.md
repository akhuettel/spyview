# Spyview

A data plotting and exploration program I wrote during my PhD: 

http://nsweb.tn.tudelft.nl/~gsteele/spyview/

I'm hosting it now on github, and have included a good first attempt by Ben to bundle it into a .app, and also from a github user "wakass" who cleaned up the c++ pointer casts to compile properly with clang (thanks wakass, whoever you are!).

# To Do list

IT’S ALIVE AGAIN! TODO list 2015!

Easy and useful:

- Keystroke for dismissing windows
- Button for loading printer settings from current directory?

Harder and very useful:

- Add “plot waterfall option?” Maybe with a gui? And a gnuplot script output option? 

Harder and moderately (or maybe minorly useful):

- Load data from images using FL_IMAGE class (low priority)
- Save colorized data as PNG using FL_IMAGE
