EXPERIMENTAL

I copied all dependent dylibs into one folder and liked 
spyview programms to search for them in the folder where it is extracted.

To install spyview simply copy this folder to whereever you like to have spyview installed.

To start spyview use the terminal go to the folder and execute spyview

./spyview
