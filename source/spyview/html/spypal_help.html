<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Spypal makes it easy to quickly generate attractive 
colormaps for <tt>spyview</tt> or other applications where
uniform colorscales are handy.</p>
<p>Spypal has two basic modes: waypoint pathfinder, and 
optimal pathfinder.  At present, optimal pathfinder is 
almost useless.</p>
<p>Each time a new colormap is generated, it is saved as a
<tt>"cmap.ppm"</tt> as an image and <tt>"cmap.txt"</tt> as human readable text.
The colormap can also be saved into a specific file using the
"Export" options in the "File" menu.</p>
