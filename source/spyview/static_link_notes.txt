otool -L 

list the libraries a program is linked against

probably best idea is to somehow make spyview an ".app" bundle that includes a private framework:

Problem with static linking: Mac won't let you make completely
statically linked binaries, and will not make mixed linking binaries
(like is possible in linux?)

However, one possibility is to make a .app bundle, including the
required dynamic libraries. A way to do this without switching over to
an Xcode build environment is outlined here:

Maybe some day I'll try it...
