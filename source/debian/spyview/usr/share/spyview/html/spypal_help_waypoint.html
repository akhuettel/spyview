<title>SpyPal: Waypoint Pathfinder</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Waypoint pathfinder allows you to specify a series of waypoints through
which <tt>SpyPal</tt> will generate a color gradient.</p>
<p>The output colors will be evenly spaced in the color space selected
in the color space dropdown.  CIELuv and CIELab are both (nominally)
perceptually uniform, so colormaps generated in these colorspaces should
be smooth, lacking sharp "breakpoints" where the color changes quickly.
If there are more than two waypoints, the spacing between colors will
be "tweaked" slightly so that each waypoint is included in the
output.</p>

<h2>Auto</h2> 
<p>If selected, the colormap will automatically be regenerated each time
a waypoint or option is changed.  If not selected, the user must press
"Go" to generate a new colormap.  <tt>SpyPal</tt> may become unresponsive
if "Auto" is selected and a complicated colormap is being worked with,
especially if <a href="#forcegamut">Force Gamut</a> is on.</p>

<h2>Force Gamut</h2> 
<p>Frequently, the path described by the waypoints will pass through
   colors that are not possible to represent in RGB colorspace, or even
   imaginary colors.  If force gamut is off, <tt>SpyPal</tt> will generate
   the path with equally spaced colors, then clip it to the RGB colorspace.
   This may result in undesirable sharp breakpoints in the color if the path
   is severely clipped.  Force Gamut causes <tt>SpyPal</tt> to clip the
   path to RGB colorspace, <emph>then</emph> generate equally spaced colors.
   This typically generates a "smoother" colormap, but is much slower.

   Note that below each color in the colorbar at the bottom of the dialog
   is a black border if the color has not been clipped, or a red border if
   clipping is occuring. </p>

<h2>Go</h2> 
<p>Generate a new colormap.  Not needed if "Auto" is selected.</p>
<a name="pathtype" />
<h2>Path Type</h2> 
<p>This controls the shape of the path through
  colorspace <tt>SpyPal</tt> uses between waypoints.  If set to
  "Straight Line", <tt>SpyPal</tt> will generate a direct path between
  the two waypoints (but see <a href="#forcegamut">Force Gamut</a>).
  If set to "Clockwise" or "Counterclockwise", <tt>SpyPal</tt> will
  generate a spiraling corkscrew where the luminosity, the distance
  from white, and the hue all ramp smoothly.  <emph>This is only
  meaningful in CIELuv, CIELab, CIEXYZ, and CIExyY colorspaces.</emph></p>

<h2>Space Waypoints Evenly</h2> 
<p>If selected, the waypoints are placed at equally spaced positions in
the output, rather than at positions determined by the requirement that
the color varies smoothly.  For example, if 300 steps have been requested
and there are 3 waypoints, the waypoints will be the first, 150th, and
300th color in the output if "Space Waypoints Evenly" is selected, while
the middle color's position will be adjusted to make the colormap uniform
if it is not selected.</p>

<p>Control how many colors are in the output colormap.</p>
