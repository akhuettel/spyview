<h1>SpyPal Color Chooser</h1>
<p>At the right of the <tt>SpyPal</tt> window is the color 
chooser.  This allows you to explore different color spaces and
select colors.  The main display shows a 2D cut through the 3D
colorspace.  In this cut, colors that can be displayed on your
monitor are shown, while colors outside the monitor's gamut 
are shown in black (windows) or shown as a translucent best 
approximation over a checkerboard (linux).</p>
<p>For some colorspaces, the visible gamut (colors humans can see)
is outlined with a green line.</p>
<p>The scrollbar to the left of the main display allows changing
which 2D cut through the colorspace to display; typically this
scrollbar changes luminosity or brightness.</p>
<p>To the left of the scrollbar is a dropdown for choosing the  
current colorspace, a "overscan" control that zooms into and out
of the colorspace, and the current color displayed in several formats.
The current color can be changed by typing into any of these boxes.
A warning will appear here if the current color cannot be displayed
on the monitor (out of sRGB gamut) or cannot be represented in the
current colorspace (out of colorspace gamut).</p>
<p>
Finally, a large swatch of the current color is displayed below any warnings.
